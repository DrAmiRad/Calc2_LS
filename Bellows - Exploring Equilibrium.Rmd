2.5 Exploring equilibrium - Program the Bellows 

The bellows model for population density of grain beetles:
$x_{n+1} = \frac{rx_n}{1+(ax_n)^b}$ - This is the generalized Bevelton - Holt model. We have that $r = 2$, $a = 0.01$ , $x^* = 100$. 

We will explore what equilibrium points mean for this system/model in relation to other solutions with different starting points:

Lets first explore $n = 50$ with $x_1 = 99$ for two cases $b = 3$ and $b = 6$
$\textbf{First case with b = 3}$
```{r code}
b = 3 # we'll start with b = 3
x <- seq(99, 150, by = 1) # I am creatimg a data set beginning from 99 to 150(exclusive) with increaments of 1 (for n = 50)
plot(x, (2*x)/(1 + (0.01 * x)^b), main = "y = Bellows model", ylab = "y", type = "l", col = "blue")
```

 
TODO: Now you can play around with $n$, $x_1$, and $b$ by changing their values and running the r chunk to observe how the equilibrium changes.
